Here's a complete `README.md` for your project that explains how the `PXAppAIManager` and `GodotSimulator` work together to allow an AI to generate and evolve pixel-based software in Godot:

# 🧠 PXApp AI Manager + Godot Simulator

This project is a **Godot-based AI software evolution environment** designed to enable **reflex-driven generation, simulation, and mutation** of visual, pixel-based applications. It is part of the larger PXOS ecosystem and supports self-evolving pixel logic via PXTalk.

---

## 🗂️ Components

### 1. `pxapp_ai_manager.gd`

**Class:** `PXAppAIManager`  
**Role:** AI Reflex Manager

This script is responsible for monitoring internal state and app behavior, then generating or evolving PXTalk logic when triggered.

#### Features:
- Observes app state and UI events.
- Tracks internal reflex metrics like:
  - `has_generated_initial_ui`
  - `button_press_reflex_count`
  - `pxtalk_generation_triggered`
- Generates PXTalk-based app logic.
- Requests evolution via `PXOSEvolutionManager`.

### 2. `godot_simulator.gd`

**Class:** `GodotSimulator`  
**Role:** Virtual App Testbed

This script provides a UI interface and runtime environment for testing generated PXTalk applications inside a simulated Godot VM.

#### Features:
- Connects to:
  - `PXGodotVM`: virtual logic executor
  - `PXVirtualGodot`: simulated Godot API
  - `PXOSState`: OS-level metadata
- UI Buttons:
  - **Create Node**
  - **Mutate**
  - **Save**
- Displays logs, node counts, and simulation feedback.

## 🧠 How AI Uses This

1. **Detects behavioral changes** in app memory or button states.
2. **Generates new PXTalk code** or mutates existing logic.
3. **Injects logic into virtual simulation** using `PXVirtualGodot`.
4. **Observes results** (success/failure, button interaction, UI creation).
5. **Repeats or adapts**, forming a self-improving pixel-based software loop.

## 📁 Directory Integration

Ensure the following nodes are present in your Godot scene tree:

```
/root
 └─ PXOSEvolutionManager
 └─ PXAppAIManager
 └─ PXGodotVM
 └─ PXVirtualGodot
 └─ PXOSState
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Add both scripts to your Godot project.
2. Instantiate `PXAppAIManager` and `GodotSimulator` in your scene.
3. Provide references via setter methods or `_ready()` injection.
4. Start simulation and trigger button presses or memory changes.
5. Watch the AI evolve new UI logic over time.

## 🔬 Vision

This framework is designed for **pixel-native software development** led by AI. Each cycle represents a mutation or evolution of logic, forming the basis for:

* Self-generated applications
* Visual programming from pixels
* Reflexive, AI-designed UIs

---

## 📌 Dependencies

* Godot 4.x
* PXTalk Interpreter (via `PXGodotVM`)
* PXOSEvolutionManager
* Optional: `pxnet`, `pxdigest`, or zTXt memory overlay systems

---

## 🧩 Example Use Case

Want your AI to generate a button-based pixel art game?

1. Trigger `CreateNodeButton`
2. Let `PXAppAIManager` detect and react
3. Watch it inject a new node tree or PXTalk script
4. Evaluate results in `GodotSimulator`
5. Evolve and save the app logic
