# 🧠 AI Sandbox Toolkit (ASTK) — Version 5.0

The AI Sandbox Toolkit is a modular, reflexive execution environment bootable from `8.png`. ASTK v5 supports AI agent orchestration, GitHub CLI integration, zTXt memory, and roadmap-driven self-evolution.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Bootable from `8.png`
- ✅ Modular agent-based architecture
- ✅ Roadmap execution and reflex updates
- ✅ GitHub CLI Integration:
  - Auto-commit files
  - Create GitHub releases
  - Upload `.zip` or `.pxdigest` bundles
- ✅ Built-in debug tools:
  - Python simulator
  - Chrome extension runner
  - Logging + changelog output

## 🐞 Debugging Support

ASTK v5 supports runtime validation of software modules.

### Debug Modules

* `python_debug_sim.py`: Tests Python logic, logs errors
* `chrome_test_runner.html`: Loads Chrome extensions for simulation
* `debug_router.py`: Chooses the correct tool for task

### Logs:

* `debug_logs/trace.log`: Execution feedback
* `debug_logs/release.md`: GitHub changelog auto-generated

---

## 🛠 Runtime Configuration

Configure toolkit behavior via `pxconfig.json` or embedded zTXt keys:

```json
{
  "pxmode": "debug",
  "pxdebug_enabled": true,
  "pxgithub_enabled": true
}
```

---

## 📤 Export & Release

Once execution is complete, use:

* `.pxdigest` to save snapshot state
* `.zip` for human inspection
* GitHub release to publish agent-generated versions
