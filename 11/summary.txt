AI Sandbox Toolkit v2 - Debugger-Enabled Edition
------------------------------------------------
Goal: Enable the AI to autonomously debug software before returning it to the user.

Features Implemented:
- pxdebug_router.py: Routes debug tasks based on file type (Chrome extension, Python script)
- chrome_test_runner.html: Simulates extension loading and JS API availability
- python_debug_sim.py: Runs and logs Python code execution errors
- pxconfig.json: Controls debug boot flags
- debug_logs/trace.log: Records debug trace
- ready_to_install flag embedded in .pxdigest structure
- Summary and logs delivered with every completed roadmap

This version ensures that software is tested, validated, and install-ready before delivery.
