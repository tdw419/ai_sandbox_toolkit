AI Sandbox Toolkit – README
Filename: README_AI_Sandbox_Toolkit.md
Version: 1.0
Project Codename: AI Sandbox Toolkit
Created with: 8.png Reflex Boot System

🧠 AI Sandbox Toolkit
The AI Sandbox Toolkit is a one-file execution system that allows you to send a single .png file (8.png) with your goal, and receive back working software, deliverables, and logs — all automatically generated and executed by the AI.

This toolkit was designed for ultra user-friendly development. No coding required. Just describe what you want.

📦 What is 8.png?
8.png is a reusable file that includes embedded zTXt metadata:

java
Copy
Edit
pxlaunch/boot = AI Sandbox Toolkit
pxstatus = ready
pxnotes = Submit your goal alongside this file. I will generate and execute the roadmap and return the deliverables.
It acts as a universal execution key — when sent to the AI, it triggers the AI Sandbox Toolkit to boot and carry out a development cycle.

🧾 How to Use
✅ Step 1: Download 8.png
→ Download 8.png
Keep this file. You can use it over and over.

✉️ Step 2: Submit a Goal
When you're ready, send the 8.png file along with a message like:

“Build a Python script that extracts titles from all Markdown files in a folder.”

⚙️ Step 3: AI Executes Automatically
Upon receiving your goal and 8.png, the AI will:

Boot into the AI Sandbox Toolkit

Auto-generate a roadmap for your goal

Execute the roadmap logic

Return only the essential results:

yourtool.py

summary.txt

roadmap_progress.log (optional)

🔁 Reusability
You can send 8.png as many times as you want, for different projects.
The AI will treat each instance as a new roadmap.

No code prep, no special formatting, no inputs needed beyond your request.

📌 Why This Works
The AI Sandbox Toolkit uses:

zTXt metadata triggers

A reflex-capable runtime (booted from your Python file)

AI-generated roadmaps and deliverables

A universal “ask and receive” design pattern

This is the foundation for fully automated development pipelines — using just a single image.

💬 Sample Prompt
“Attached is 8.png. Please create a command-line tool that resizes all .png images in a folder to 512×512.”

AI will return:

resize_tool.py

summary.txt describing what was done












"Attached is 8.png. Please use it as an AI Sandbox Toolkit to complete this roadmap and return the working code files and a summary."
